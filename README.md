# Solarized Light (Custom)

Custom solarized theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com),
optimized for JavaScript, TypeScript, (S)CSS, HTML and JSON, but maybe
some other languages work too.

You can change the accent color through the command palette, or by setting `solarizedCustomTheme.accentColor` inside `settings.json`
Type solarized custom, choose Solarized custom Theme: Set accent color, and pick one color from the list.
